The goal of PHM is to maximize the reliability and availability of equipment while minimizing maintenance costs and downtime.\nHere is the process of PHM, firstly, you try to acquire the data form the applications, then process what you get. After this, do a condition assessment and then you can diagnose and prognose from the results.

Specifically, I am working on developing intelligent sensor nodes to monitor real-time operational parameters such as engine speed, cooling water temperature, and pressure.
