# tea break

## self-Introduction
- hometown  
	我在重庆开州长大，那是一个典型的重庆风格的县城，意思是它继承了重庆多雾、多山的特征（指着第一张图片）。当然，有山的地方自然少不了水，这是开州的一个特色景点，汉丰湖，它是个放松心情的好地方，还有着皮划艇、龙舟、桨板、摩托艇等水上休闲运动。此外，开州也是刘伯承元帅的家乡，你可以在刘伯承纪念馆中去参观。至于特色美食，这里也有冰薄、龙珠茶、南门红糖、椒麻牛肉等等。总的来说，我认为开州是一个山水相间，历史悠久的好地方。
- hobbies  
	我喜欢玩电子游戏，我认为它们有趣、刺激、充满挑战。它们可以让我在休闲时间里体验不同的乐趣，这种乐趣是无法通过其他方式得到的。另外，电子游戏还能帮助我开发思维能力，增强学习能力。电子游戏是一种有效的娱乐方式，它能够让我们在紧张的工作之余得到休息和放松。这里是一些我喜欢的游戏，尤其是黑暗之魂系列，这个系列的游戏非常有挑战性，需要耐心和集中精神。它帮助我训练了我的反应速度、空间认知能力和团队协作精神。我也喜欢玩类似于《Terraria》这样的创造性游戏，它可以激发我的想象力和创造力，让我能够自由地构建自己的世界。总的来说，电子游戏对我来说不仅是一种娱乐，也是一种能够开发我的思维和创造力的活动。当然，我也会控制玩游戏的时间，确保它不会影响到我的工作和生活。 它具有良好的画面，极具挑战性的难度，以及丰富的游戏内容。    

	我喜欢跑步，因为它能让身体变得更健康，同时也能提高心情和增强耐力。当前，我跑的并不快，不过我享受着跑步的乐趣，这是我上学期跑的一次半程马拉松。一次长跑下来确实很累，但跑完的那一刻，你会想到，一切都是值得的。
	我跑步没有什么特别的动机的动机，但也有很多东西激励了我。例如这部动漫，和这个男人。他说：“没有人是有限制的。”对于每一个拥有梦想和追逐梦想的人来说，只要有足够的信心和勇气，他们就可以超越自己的限制，达成自己的目标。

## rerearch direction and intrest


Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) can be applied to a wide range of industries and systems, including aerospace, defense, automotive,   energy, manufacturing, and healthcare. PHM is a predictive maintenance strategy that uses data-driven analytics to predict when components or systems may fail. It can be used to identify potential problems before they occur and take proactive steps to avoid or mitigate their occurrence. PHM includes the use of sensors, machine learning algorithms, and artificial intelligence (AI) to detect anomalies in system behavior and provide early warning of potential system failure. It also enables the identification of root cause analysis that can help reduce chronic downtime costs, increase safety, and improve operational performance.

## 流程


- Hello, Nice to meet you! May I ask what your name is?

You can answer, "Hi, my name is [Your Name], and I'm also a marine engineering researcher. Nice to meet you too!"

Next, I'm interested in learning more about your background and hobbies. Where are you from? What are your hobbies?

You can answer, "I'm from [Your Hometown], and my hobbies include [Your Hobbies]. How about you?"

Moving on, I would like to know more about your education background and research focus. Where did you earn your undergraduate degree? What was your major? And what is your current research focus?

You can answer, "I graduated from [Your Undergraduate University] with a degree in [Your Major]. Currently, I'm researching [Your Research Focus]."

Now that we have some basic understanding, we can further discuss our research interests and focus. You can ask about my research interests and focus, or you can share your own research interests and focus.

`J`: Good morning everyone, today, my partner and I will simulate an academic exchange during  tea break.  

`J`: Nice to meet you.My [name] is Jiang Xingxu. what's your name?  

`W`: MY [name] is .... Your name sounds familiar, I think I've heard it before.  May I ask if you went to Chongqing University for your undergraduate studies?

`J`: yeah.My [undergraduate major] was Electronic Science and Technology, and now I am studying Instrument Science and Technology as a graduate student. Did we come from the same major before?

`W`: What a coincidence! Our majors are the same for both undergraduate and graduate degrees. We should have communicated more before. I don't even know where your hometown is?

`J`: It's indeed a coincidence. My [hometown] is ......      what about you?

`W`: My hometown is ......    by the way.I like ..[hobbies].what's your hobbies.

`J`: I enjoy [hobbies] as well. It seems we share some common interests, maybe we can play games together sometime. For now, shall we discuss our research directions or interests?

`W`: Sure, that sounds good to me.I'm particularly interested in [research directions or interests]. How about you?

`J`: Your research direction is really fascinating and cutting-edge. I study in [research directions or interests]. I'm very interested in your research direction, maybe we can have a deeper discussion about it later on.

`J`: Thank you for listening to our talk.Please feel free to ask any questions or share your thoughts.

`Q`:  
- Do you play video games?  Can you tell us about your favourite games?
- Do you have any learning plans or learning paths in your research field?


Good morning everyone, today, my partner and I will simulate an academic exchange during  tea break.  

Nice to meet you. My name is Jiang Xingxu. what's your name?  


Yeah. My undergraduate major was Electronic Science and Technology, and now I am studying Instrument Science and Technology as a graduate student. Did we come from the same major before?


It's indeed a coincidence. My [hometown] is Kaizhou，which is a typical Chongqing-style county it inherits the characteristics of Chongqing's foggy and mountainous landscape (just like the first picture).  Of course, where there are mountains, there is no shortage of water, and one of Kaizhou's special attractions is Hanfeng Lake, a great place to relax and enjoy water sports such as motor boating. Kaizhou is also the hometown of  Liu Bo-cheng, and you can visit him at the Liu Bo-cheng Memorial Hall. As for special food, there are also ice thin moon cake, dragon pearl tea, Nanmen brown sugar, pepper beef and so on. All in all, I think Kaizhou is a great place with a rich history, surrounded by beautiful mountains and rivers. what about you?

I enjoy  video games as well. I think it is fun, exciting and challenging. They allow me to experience different kinds of fun in my leisure time. Here are some of my favorite games, especially the Dark Souls series, which is very challenging and requires patience and concentration.  I also enjoy  creative games like Terraria, which stimulates my imagination  and gives me the freedom to build my own world.  I also like running because it can make my body healthier and improve my mood and endurance.  This is a half marathon I ran last semester. It was very tiring to run for such a long distance, but at the moment of completion, you will feel that everything is worth it. here is one of my favorite anime <run with the wind>,which mainly talk about running.  it is very amazing. and this man named Kipchoge, once said, "No human is limited." this is very encouraging. For everyone who has dreams to pursue, as long as they have enough confidence and courage, they can surpass their limitations and achieve their goals.It seems we share some common interests, maybe we can play games together sometime. For now, shall we discuss our research directions or interests?

Your research direction is really fascinating and cutting-edge. What I focus on is Prognostics and Health Management (PHM).It is a method of monitoring and analyzing the health and performance of systems and equipment. It involves using sensors and data analysis techniques to detect changes in the behavior of a system or component and determine if they are indicative of potential failures or degradation. PHM can be applied to a wide range of industries and systems, including aerospace, defense, automotive, and manufacturing. The goal of PHM is to maximize the reliability and availability of equipment while minimizing maintenance costs and downtime.
Here is the process of PHM, firstly, you try to acquire the data form the applications, then process what you get. After this, do a condition assessment and then you can diagnose and prognose from the results. Which helps you to make a decision to send a order by the Human machine interface. 
My research focus is on the health monitoring and fault diagnosis of marine engines. Specifically, I am working on developing intelligent sensor nodes to monitor real-time operational parameters such as engine speed, cooling water temperature, and pressure. Additionally, I am developing an information-based service support platform to provide intelligent decision-making assistance for engine maintenance and repair. I'm very interested in your research direction, maybe we can have a deeper discussion about it later on.

Thank you for listening to our talk. Please feel free to ask any questions or share your thoughts.
